Nostalgi
========

Java and LWJGL SceneGraph aimed for game development prototyping

Currently Nostalgi is written for LWJGL, but it's writen in a way that LWJGL is abstracted away from the core engine!

You should be able to farily simply write a new renderer that uses OpenGL ES instead of LWJGL..
